Thank you for the detailed answers! I now have a very clear understanding of the project requirements. Let me summarize the key points to ensure we're aligned before starting the implementation:

System Architecture Overview:

1. **Course Structure**:
   - Hierarchical JSON structure with nested content
   - Three levels: Course → Section → Chapter
   - Each chapter contains an array of text content
   - No metadata for now

2. **Database Design**:
   - Store all chapters (both initial and generated) in the database
   - User-specific chapters linked to user profiles
   - No backup system required initially

3. **User Interface Flow**:
   - Basic navigation to frontmost unfinished chapter
   - No auto-save or recovery for interrupted sessions
   - Countdown timer for API rate limiting
   - Save progress when waiting for API responses

4. **Admin Features**:
   - Standard Django admin interface
   - View personalized chapters per user
   - Optional course addition through admin interface

5. **Content Generation**:
   - No preview functionality
   - No regeneration option
   - Chapters are permanent once generated

6. **Error Handling**:
   - Simple restart for interrupted sessions
   - No analytics or monitoring required

Before we start coding, I have just two final technical questions:

1. **API Integration**:
   - I will use Google Cloud's service account's key
   - the API calls should be implemented in a way that makes it easy to switch to a different LLM provider in the future

2. **Development Priority**:
   I want to start implementing stuffs in this order:
   - LLM API calling system
   - content generation system (chapters, exams, exercises)
   - bare minimum user authentication and course-selecting system (just enough that 1 course can be accessed & study by user)
   - exam & exercise grading system
   - a system that determine user's knowledge
   - the rest of  user authentication and course-selecting system

Do not start yet, just tell me if you have no more questions and are ready

Once you confirm these points, we can begin implementing the project step by step.
