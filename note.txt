TODO: adjust Course model
- Remove user and knowledge_level fields
- explaination: For now, a Course object will only be used for holding its content, which is used when creating chapters

I need to make a system for:
<goal>
- Display Exam & Exercise for user to answer (user will enter the Exam through the course page, and enter the Exercise through the Chapter page)
- Extract & Grade user's answers for the Exam/Exercise
- Determine user's knowledge based on their Exam/Exercise result 
</goal>

Based on the requirement document and the current structure of the project, how should I implement the system mentioned above?
<choice>
1) Make a seperate django app for displaying & grading Exam/Exercise, and determining user's knowledge
2) Make the system(urls, views, templates, other required functions) for displaying & grading Exam/Exercise, and determining user's knowledge inside one of the exist apps
