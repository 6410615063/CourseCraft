TODO: figuring out chapter/extra chapter generation system

have: full course content

chapter gen.:
    get user knowledge as list
    filter content, remove user's knowledge from it
        problem: outputing the remaining content might be too big -> exceed token limit -> error
    gen. summary of chapters using filtered content
    gen. chapter using summary


extra chapter gen.:
    get user unknown as list
    filter content, leaving only user's unknown
        problem: outputing the remaining content might be too big -> exceed token limit -> error
    gen. summary of chapters using filtered content
    gen. chapter using summary

solution to problem:
1. instead of working with full course content, turn it into summary first
2. split the course content to gurrantee that the output will not exceed token limit

all function needed:
summarize_course: summariez course content
filter_knowledge: remove knowledge
filter_unknown: keep only unknown
split_content: course_summary -> chapter_summary
generate_chapter: chapter_summary -> chapter_content
